Soaplin is an operating system kernel for the x86_64 architecture, meant to be used on Project Jupiter.

##Â Acknowledgements
Soaplin in it's current state would not be possible without all
these third-party projects:

* Limine (by Mintsuki and contributors): A great long-mode aware bootloader with it's own protocol.
* NanoPrintF (by Charles Nicholson): A small printf implementation used in Soaplin for displaying kernel logs with formatting.
* freestnd-c-hdrs-0bsd (by Mintsuki and contributors): 0BSD-licensed (so MIT-compatible) freestanding headers
